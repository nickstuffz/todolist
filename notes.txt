long-term goals:

add masonry to float projects up into empty space

implement drag and drop to allow tasks to switch projects

rewrite project using State reflective logic, rather than clearing and re-displaying


_______________

ESLint project after, how to undo? separate copy? use a branch

Tailwind prettier plugin can't get to work with classList.add

_____________
TODO:

*clean up event listeners and how they are stored


long term:
*speed rebuild, select project to rebuild rather than rebuilding all
*refactor code into state reflection rather than rebuild, REACT?
*figure out how to save data on keydown instead of blur

BUGS:
*mouseenter functions buggy, disabled for now

*text overflow and focus, maybe limit length?
